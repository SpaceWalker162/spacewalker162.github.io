An infant is innocent as (s)he knows nothing. As (s)he grows and by her/his interaction with the environment, (s)he learns the rules of nature and the codes of society. Yet the surroundings that surround her/him are unlikely in such an order that (s)he could perceive those rules directly. On the very contrary, they are so chaotic that nothing is not interweaved by any other. The means by which (s)he perceives, however, is simple. (S)He senses, thinks, and practices. As such, those pertinent sensations are shifted from the totality of the experienced sensations, and most importantly, with the addition of her/his own imagination.

A civilization is rather similar to an infant. The environment facing it is also complex, and in this case the major agency of perception is scientists. They distill data and rules by means of experiments and thinking. The knowledge thus obtained is never pure, however, in the sense that it is never mere reductions and simplifications of the nature. It is a mixture of artifacts and facts.
