Normal Field Analysis (NFA) is a technique developed by Shen et al. (2020, doi:10.1029/2020JA028163) to investigate surfaces in space plasmas. It requires the measurement obtained by at least four spacecraft that fly in formation. For a brief introduction to the technique, see [a supporting information to one of my publication](/files/papers/2023/supportingInfo.pdf).
