The Master and his disciples visited the fish fair with the intention of acquiring fish.

The Master said, Today our mission is to purchase fishes. Each of us shall prepare an individual fish. And now let's engage in a challenge: venture through the fair and purchase the finest fish. Remember, once you pass by a fish, you cannot return to claim those you've previously passed over.

Zilu took the lead. He opted to pass by the initial fine fish, trusting in the abundance ahead and anticipating even better options. This mindset guided him until the far end of the fair came into view. Zilu firmly resolved to choose his fish from this concluding stretch, yet with every wallet extraction, he hesitated, the available fish never matching the excellence he had witnessed earlier. Ultimately, he departed empty-handed, reconciling with the pangs of hunger for the day.

Yanhui assumed the second. Having learned the lesson from Zilu, he procured the first fish he encountered and traversed the fair with unwavering commitment.

Charting a distinct course, Zigong, the wealthiest of the disciples, disregarded the prior methods. Upon his return, the Master inquired about his plethora of fish purchases. Zigong's response was swift: he had acquired all the fishes he deemed of high quality. One would grace his table today, while the rest would find a home in his pond, destined for future feasts.

The fourth entrant to the fair was Zihui, armed with a prowess in mathematics and economics. Drawing from this expertise, he meticulously calculated his optimal [strategy](/files/miscellaneous/purchasing_fishes.pdf) to secure the finest fish.
