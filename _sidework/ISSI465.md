Teams are composed of about 8-15 scientists of different laboratories, nationalities and expertise. They hold a series of two to three one-week meetings over a period of 12 to 18 months. Exceptionally Teams may choose to have only one one-week meeting with larger participation, i.e., a “Team Workshop”. The aim of Teams is to carry out a research project leading to publications in scientific journals. The activity is directed and organized by a team leader who is also the initiator of the proposal to ISSI. Though in close contact with the scientific staff of the Institute, teams are largely autonomous in the execution of their project. Teams are set up in response to an Annual Call by ISSI. Proposals are evaluated and prioritized by the Science Committee.
