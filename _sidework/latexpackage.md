## Content
* Note template:  Contains the template I use for writing notes on different topics.

* Author response template: Contains the template I use to reply to reviewers.

* Reviewer response template: Contains the template I use for reviewing

* Teaching experience template: Contains the template I use for organizing my teaching experience. It can also be used for making short syllabus for the courses you are responsible for.

* Cover letter: Contains the template I use for cover letters. It's a very simple format with a few details of KTH (current institution). Nothing fancy, with a few adaptations it can be used for any case.

To use any of these, simply add the content as a project in Overleaf.

## Acknowledgments
The template for note taking is basically a modified/simplified version taken from [CASTEL](https://castel.dev/). If you want even more advanced work visit his website. For information on how to optimize your note taking routine during courses/workshops, read the articles on his website.

The template for the reviewer and author replies are based on the work of [github-mschroen](https://github.com/mschroen/review_response_letter). I added a few extra things that I preferred and I removed a couple that I didn't find useful. If you prefer to use markdown rather than LaTeX for your replies check his GitHub page.
