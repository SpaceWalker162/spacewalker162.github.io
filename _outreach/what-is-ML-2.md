## Article

One of the most widely used technique of supervised learning is the  so called Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Historically, the research of biological neurons and the human brain has greatly influenced the development of ANNs. By simplifying, we can say that for humans as we grow older our brain learns which neurons to activate based on what input it receives from our senses. Then, it can adapt how strongly each neuron is activated while also connecting different neurons together (synapses).  Through this process it can actually learn new information and understand how to perform certain tasks. Regarding "artificial" neural networks, the first references appear by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in 1943, while an actual neural networks appear much later in 1957 by the psychologist Frank Rosenblatt.

Below we can see a simplistic comparison between a biological (left) and an artificial (right) neural network.
