Two-minute science (2’ science) is a science communication project initiated and supported by early-career Greek astrophysicists and space physicists. Since December 2020 an effort by all the members of the project is conducted to bridge the gap between the scientific community and the public of Greek readers. The idea behind the project is to write short articles that have an approximate reading time of two minutes. These articles are separated in three difficulty levels to cover a broad range of readers, starting from your students to experiences adults. Furthermore, we include the opportunity to “ask an expert” where any reader can post a question that will be addressed by a researcher of the field. These questions are answered by the board of the team or by contacting an expert from the Greek astronomical society
